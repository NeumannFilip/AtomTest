# Introduction

Atom is a UE5 project designed to serve as a modular framework for quick prototyping in 3rd person games, specifically top-down games with mechanics similar to Jagged Alliance, X-Com, or Diablo. The primary focus is on creating reusable controllers and components that allow control over multiple characters simultaneously.
